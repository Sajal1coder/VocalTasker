# Voice Tasker 🎤✅
A **Voice Task Manager** built using the MERN stack that allows users to manage tasks via voice commands. It features secure authentication, real-time notifications, and a responsive UI. Tasks are stored in MongoDB, with the app hosted on Vercel.

## Features ✨
Voice-Activated Task Management: Add, update, and delete tasks with simple voice commands.
User Authentication: Secure registration and login using bcrypt for password encryption.
Task Storage: All tasks are stored in MongoDB, allowing easy access and management.
Real-Time Notifications: Task status updates and feedback are delivered using React Toastify.
Fully Online: The app is hosted on Vercel, making it accessible from anywhere.
